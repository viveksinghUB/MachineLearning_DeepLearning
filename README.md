# ${1:Complete repository from Machine Learning to Deep Learning}

Here is my set of projects/notes/notebooks/codes/papers that I have gone through/implemented
to gain deep understanding of Deep Learning and Machine Learning Concepts

## Current work

Currently the folder Deep Learning Project is Active.
Under Deep Learning Project you will find all the papers and research work and models I am implementing
to understand document classification using Neural Network.
I will be implementing Bag of Words, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, LSTM, Multi task Learning & PVDM
over Kaggel dataset for " Personalized Medicine: Redefining Cancer Treatment Â·" competetion.

## Usage

You can download the notebooks and try it on your own.
In the Input folder you will find the dataset.

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D

## History

It all started with Machine Learning course by Professor Andrew Ng on coursera.
It attracted all my attention and I began diving deep into it to gain as much knowledge as possible.
My coursework in AI specialization at UB has served me well in understanding the math behind Machine Learning models.

## Credits

Dr. Varun Chadola, Dr. Kenneth Regan, Dr. S. Srihari , Dr. Andrew Ng & my personal favorite Ian Goodfellow.

##Special Request

Please donot copy the projects. However you can tweak, learn & implement.
